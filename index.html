                  <br>

                  <h6>- Imran Khan's persistence paid off in July 2018, as the PTI emerged victorious in the national elections.

          <h1>IMRAN KHAN: POLITICAL CAREER</h1>
          <hr class="line">
        </center>
        <h5>Khan is typically characterized as a Pakistani nationalist and a populist, drawing inspiration from the
          poet-philosopher Muhammad Iqbal and the Iranian writer-sociologist Ali Shariati, whom he encountered during his
          youth.[126] Khan has made several political pronouncements and platform announcements, including a return to
          Islamic values in the 1990s, liberal economics with the goal of deregulating the economy and establishing a
          welfare state, less bureaucracy and the application of anti-corruption laws to ensure a clean government, the
          establishment of an independent judiciary, reforming the nation's police force, and an anti-militant vision for a
          democratic Pakistan.
        </h5>
    
        <h4>Formation of Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI):<h4>
            <h6> Imran Khan founded PTI in 1996 with the aim of creating a political platform focused on anti-corruption,
              social justice, and accountability. The party's initial years were marked by struggles to gain mainstream
              support, but it gradually emerged as a significant player in Pakistani politics.
            </h6>
            <strong>Advocacy and Opposition (1996-2013):</strong>
            <h6>In the years leading up to the 2013 general elections, Imran Khan and PTI focused on grassroots mobilization
              and advocacy for political reforms. Khan was a vocal critic of corruption within the Pakistani political
              establishment and called for accountability and transparency in governance.</h6>
            <strong>Electoral Breakthrough (2013):</strong>
            <h6>On April 21, 2013, Khan gave a speech to thousands of supporters at the Mall to kick off his last public
              relations campaign for the 2013 Pakistani general election.[199] Khan declared he will restore peace to the
              Pashtun tribal area and remove Pakistan from the US-led war on terror.[200] He gave speeches at several public
              gatherings in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and other regions of the nation, announcing that the PTI will implement a
              uniform education system that would provide equal opportunity for the children of wealthy and impoverished
              families.[201] Khan addressed rallies in several Seraiki belt cities as he concluded his campaign in south
              Punjab.[202]Lying on a bed in a Lahore hospital, Khan concluded the campaign by speaking via video hookup to a
              gathering of supporters in Islamabad.[203] The Herald's most recent poll conducted prior to the polls revealed
              that 24.98 percent of voters nationwide intended to support his party, just trailing the PML-N, the political
              party of former prime minister Nawaz Sharif.[204][205] Four days prior to the elections, on May 7, Khan was
              taken to Shaukat Khanum hospital in Lahore after he fell headfirst from a forklift that had fallen at the edge
              of a stage.[206][207] On May 11, 2013, general elections were conducted throughout Pakistan. The Pakistan
              Muslim League (N) became victorious in the elections.[208][209] The PTI led by Khan became the second-largest
              party.nationwide, including in Karachi, by popular vote.[210][211] Khan's group After Pakistan People's Party
              came in second, PTI gained 30 seats in the National Assembly through direct elections, making it the
              third-largest party in the assembly.</h6>
            <strong>2014 Dharna (Sit-in) and Azadi March:</strong>
            <h6>Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf, led by Khan, emerged as the opposition party in Sindh and Punjab. Khan rose to
              become his party's parliamentary leader.[213][214] Khan received a contempt of court notice on July 31, 2013,
              for remarks he made about the superior judiciary and for calling the judiciary "shameful" [215]. The
              notification was withdrawn when Khan complained to the Supreme Court about the activities of the lower
              judiciary during the general election in May 2013 while those judges were serving as returning officers.[216]
              Khan's party created the provincial administration after swooping into the militant-hit northwest of Khyber
              Pakhtunkhwa.[217][218] The government of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, led by the PTI, unveiled a balanced, tax-free
              budget for the 2013–14 fiscal year.[219] Khan faced criticism while serving as the provincial governor for
              endorsing Sami-ul-Haq, the "Father ofthe Taliban" and contributing money to Darul Uloom Haqqania, his
              seminary.Khan even offered the Pakistani Taliban the opportunity to open an office in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa in
              the hopes of negotiating with them to discontinue their terrorist activities. He said that after a drone
              attack killed Pakistani Taliban leader Hakimullah Mehsud in 2013, the US was undermining peace negotiations
              with the group.[224] Imran Khan led a group of supporters in a
              demonstration from Lahore to Islamabad on August 14, 2014, calling for the resignation of Prime Minister Nawaz
              Sharif and an inquiry into claims of electoral fraud.[225] Khan's convoy was ambushed by stones from PML (N)
              supporters in Gujranwala while en route to the capital, however no one was killed.[226] Khan was reportedly
              subjected to gunfire, necessitating his transportation in a vehicle designed to withstand bullets.[227]
              Protesters headed by Khan arrived in the capital on August 15 and marched into the high-security Red Zone a
              few days later. Al Jazeera reported that on September 1, 2014, demonstrators tried to storm Prime Minister
              Nawaz Sharif'sofficial residence, which set off the violent sequence. Over 595 people were hurt, including 115
              police officers, and three people lost their lives.[228] Before the fatal violence broke out, Khan urged his
              adherents to enforce the law themselves.By September 2014, Khan and Muhammad Tahir-ul-Qadri, a
              Pakistani-Canadian cleric, had formed a de facto partnership with the goal of mobilizing their respective
              constituencies for regime change.[230][231] Khan signed a deal with the Sharif government to create a powerful
              three-person judicial body that would be established by presidential edict. The panel decided to release its
              final report to the public. In accordance with articles 58(1) and 112(1) of the Constitution, the prime
              minister would dissolve the national and provincial assemblies, name a caretaker government after consulting
              with the head of the opposition, and call for new elections if the commission determined that there was
              evidence of widespread election rigging.[232] Syed Mustafa Kamal was another person he met when he was in the
              opposition.</h6>
            <strong>2018 General Elections and Prime Ministership:</strong>
            <h6>From NA-35 (Bannu), NA-53 (Islamabad-II), NA-95 (Mianwali-I), NA-131 (Lahore-IX), and NA-243 (Karachi
              East-II), Khan ran in the 2018 Pakistani general election.[233] Khan was ahead of the pack, according to
              preliminary official results, despite widespread allegations of vote-rigging and administrative wrongdoing by
              his rivals, particularly the PML-N.[234, 235, 236] Election officials said on July 27 that Khan's party has
              secured 110 out of 269 seats, giving PTI a majority in the National Assembly [237].[238][239][184] The
              Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) declared that the PTI had won 116 out of the 270 seats that were
              contested at the end of the count on July 28. Khan surpassed Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, who ran in four but was
              defeated in one, to become the first candidate in Pakistani election history to win in all five
              constituenciesin 1970, three constituencies.
              Khan's party unveiled a 100-day plan for a potential future government in May 2018. Broad reforms in nearly
              every sector of the government were on the agenda, such as the establishment of a new province in Southern
              Punjab, the expeditious consolidation of Federally Administered Tribal Areas into Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, the
              enhancement of law and order conditions in Karachi, and the improvement of ties with Baloch political
              leaders.A number of opposition groups have accused the military of interfering in the general elections,
              alleging "massive rigging" in Khan's favor.[245] In particular, Nawaz Sharif and his PML-N party asserted that
              Khan and the PTI had won the election due to a plot by the military and judiciary.[246] Amid
              lingering'reservations' about the outcome, Sharif and his PML-N ultimately recognized Khan's victory, after
              the Election Commission dismissed claims of rigging.[247][248] Michael Gahler, the top observer of the
              European Union Election Observation Mission to Pakistan, certified two days after the 2018 general elections
              that the general election's overall circumstances were satisfactory.
            </h6>
            <strong>Challenges and Criticism:</strong>
            <h6>Imran Khan's tenure as Prime Minister has been marked by challenges, including economic difficulties,
              political opposition, and criticism of his leadership style. His government has faced scrutiny over its
              handling of economic issues, including inflation and fiscal management. Additionally, Khan has been criticized
              for his handling of human rights issues and relations with the military establishmen Throughout his political
              career, Imran Khan has maintained a populist appeal,presenting himself as a champion of the people against
              entrenched political elites. Despite facing numerous challenges and criticisms, he remains a prominent and
              influential figure in Pakistani politics.</h6>

              <h6>Imran Khan was born on 5 October 1952 in Lahore to father Ikramullah Khan Niazi, a civil engineer, and mother
                Shaukat KhanumKhan.In his childhood and youth he was a quiet and shy boy. Khan grew up with his four sisters in
                relatively affluent (upper middle-class) circumstances and received a privileged education. Khan's parents were
                moderate and practicing Muslims.Khan's mother hailed from the Burki Pashtun tribe settled in Jalandhar, Punjab,
                which emigrated a few centuries ago from South Waziristan in the tribal areas of northwest Pakistan.Khan's
                maternal family has produced several great cricketers, the most prominent of whom are Javed Burki and Majid Khan
              </h6>
        
              <h6>Khan's mother, Shaukat Khanum, was a housewife. She was born in Jalandhar, before the partition of India.[39]
                He credits his mother as having played a deep influential role in his upbringing. In 1985, she died due to
                cancer. The helplessness and personal experience of seeing his mother diagnosed with cancer, which became the
                cause of her death, motivated Khan to build a cancer hospital in Pakistan where those who could not afford
                expensive care could be treated well. In 1994, the Shaukat Khanum Memorial Cancer Hospital & Research Centre was
                founded by Khan in Lahore, and named in memory of his mother. khan father,Ikramullah Niazi served as a board
                member of the Shaukat Khanum Memorial Cancer Hospital & Research Centre during his later years.[36] He died on
                19 March 2008 at the age of 85 from pneumonia, after a protracted illness for which he was being treated at
                Shaukat Khanum cancer hospital. He is buried at the family's ancestral graveyard in Mianwali</h6>
        
              <h6>On 16 May 1995, Khan married Jemima Goldsmith, in a traditional Pakistani wedding ceremony in Paris. A month
                later, on 21 June, they were married again in a civil ceremony at the Richmond registry office in England,
                followed by a reception at the Goldsmiths' house in Surrey which was attended by London's elite. The wedding was
                named by the media as "The wedding of the century".The marriage, described as "tough" by Khan,ended in 2004
                after nine years.The marriage produced two sons, Sulaiman Isa (born 18 November 1996) and Kasim (born 10 April
                1999). During the marriage Jemima actively participated in a Khan led charity drive for the Shaukat Khanum
                Memorial Cancer Hospital & Research Centre and also supported her husband in starting his initial political
                career.<h6>
        
        
                  <h6>In January 2015, Imran Khan married British Pakistani journalist and television anchor Reham Khan, after
                    months of speculation. The marriage was conducted via a simple nikah ceremony at Khan's residence in Bani
                    Gala.The marriage ended in divorce nine months later, in October 2015.Khan's former wife, Reham Khan,
                    alleged in her book that he had told her that he had four other children out of wedlock in addition to
                    Tyrian White. Allegedly, some of his children had Indian mothers and the eldest was aged 34 in 2018. Reham
                    subsequently conceded that she did not know the identities of Khan's children or the veracity of his
                    statements and that "you can never make out whether he tells the truth."Reham's book was published on 12
                    July 2018, 13 days before the 2018 Pakistani general election, leading to claims that its publication was
                    intended to damage Imran Khan's electoral prospects.</h6>
        
                  <h6>In mid-2016, late 2017 and early 2018, reports emerged that Khan had married his spiritual mentor
                    (murshid), Bushra Bibi. Khan himself, alongside PTI aides,as well as members of the Manika family, denied
                    the rumour. Khan termed the media "unethical" for spreading the rumour, and PTI filed a complaint against
                    the news channels that had aired it.On 7 January 2018, the PTI central secretariat issued a statement that
                    said Khan had proposed to Manika, but she had not yet accepted his proposal. On 18 February 2018, PTI
                    confirmed Khan has married Manika.According to Khan, his life has been influenced by Sufism for three
                    decades, and this is what drew him closer to his wife. The Mufti who conducted the marriage later testified
                    to a court that Khan's nikah had been conducted twice. The first nikah was conducted on 1 January 2018,
                    while his to-be wife was still in her Iddat, as Khan believed he would become prime minister if he married
                    her on that date. Khan resided in his sprawling farmhouse at Bani Gala. As of 2018, he owned five pet dogs,
                    who resided in his estate.</h6>
